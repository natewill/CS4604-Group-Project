Okay, so lets focus on how we request to get a Route

Firstly We have google.maps.DirectionsService
- This has DirectionsRequest and a callback

DirectionsRequest
- Requires {Destination, Origin, & Travel Mode}
- We pass latlng of start and end, then WALKING
- Returns DirectionsResult

DirectionsResult


When I Generate a Route I need to store the distance and other data needed in 
 order to reconstruct the route

I might be able to store starting and ending location along with polyline
from here I can place start and end marker with the polyline

JWT tokens
1. User signs in → Server validates credentials
2. Server creates JWT token with user data (runner_id, is_leader, etc.)
3. Token sent to client (cookie or response body)
4. Client includes token in API requests
5. Server validates token on each request
6. Token expires → User must sign in again
