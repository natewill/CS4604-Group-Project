Okay, so lets focus on how we request to get a Route

Firstly We have google.maps.DirectionsService
- This has DirectionsRequest and a callback

DirectionsRequest
- Requires {Destination, Origin, & Travel Mode}
- We pass latlng of start and end, then WALKING
- Returns DirectionsResult

DirectionsResult


When I Generate a Route I need to store the distance and other data needed in 
 order to reconstruct the route

I might be able to store starting and ending location along with polyline
from here I can place start and end marker with the polyline

JWT tokens
1. User signs in → Server validates credentials
2. Server creates JWT token with user data (runner_id, is_leader, etc.)
3. Token sent to client (cookie or response body)
4. Client includes token in API requests
5. Server validates token on each request
6. Token expires → User must sign in again


Lets make Signup/Login page
Signup and Login should give Token and go to homepage
Logout should remove token and return to Signup/Login page

Next Steps work on logout and removing cookie
Home page once logged in
Creating a run

We should make bunch of changes to database about optional fields

JWT signin
Try to go to home page (must validate cookie)
if no valid cookie then redirect to login page
upon successful login go to home
